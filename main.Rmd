# Awesome heading

```{r claudine-plot, echo=FALSE, out.width='0.98\\columnwidth', fig.cap="Claudine's greatness as a function of COVID vaccine distribution"}
plot(pressure)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:claudine-plot) shows that Claudine is **great**!

## Imagine I'm reporting tabular data
As we can clearly see from Table \@ref(tab:ulrik-table), Ulrik is also pretty **great**!

```{r ulrik-table, echo=FALSE}
some_table <- head(iris)

knitr::kable(some_table, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Numbers that show Ulrik's greatness by virtue of lengths and widths of some plants.")
```
